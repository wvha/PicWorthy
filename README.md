## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

From within the root directory:

```
npm install
```

### Running

To start server: 

```
npm run server-dev
```

To start webpack: 

```
npm run react-dev
```

### Overall Flow 

After logging in, the page renders locations.jsx. A map will be displayed where the user can search for locations or click on a cluster. This is done within worthymap.jsx and uses [react-google-maps](https://tomchentw.github.io/react-google-maps/).

The user can scroll through pictures, click on them to see details, and favorite the place. This is separated into a few different components: picrow.jsx, card.jsx, and details.jsx. 

Any information sent to the server is sent using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). Once the information gets to the server, [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/basic-components) is used to direct it to the proper controller method. 

The database consists of two schemas. One stores the image information and the other stores the user information. 

### Deployment 

Merge with mater branch of [PicWorthy](https://github.com/PicWorthy/PicWorthy) and Heroku will process updates automatically.
